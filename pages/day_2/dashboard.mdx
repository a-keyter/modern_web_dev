# Building a User Dashboard.

Congratulations, you've implemented Authentication using Supabase.

Now, we need a place for the user to go once they've successfully logged in.

Typically, this will be some kind of Dashboard, where the user can see current content.

Let's build the layout for this User Dashboard.

## Hidden Routes - User Layout

In NextJS, we can create hidden routes for users, to help us manage file structure.

In your app directory, create a new folder called `(user)`

Then, in the (user) directory, create a file called `dashboard/page.tsx` and a file called `create/page.tsx`

In each page type rfce, and you'll generate a component.

You can change the contents of the pages to something like this:

```tsx filename="(user)/dashboard/page.tsx" copy
import React from 'react'

function page() {
  return (
    <div>Welcome to the Dashboard</div>
  )
}

export default page
```

```tsx filename="(user)/create/page.tsx" copy
import React from 'react'

function page() {
  return (
    <div>Welcome to the Create Post Page</div>
  )
}

export default page
```

## User Layout

Next up, we'll want to create a UserNav that a user will use to navigate the actions they can take.

Head into your Components folder and create a new file called `UserNav.tsx`

Then smash your rfce to initialise the component:

```tsx filename="components/UserNav.tsx" copy
import React from 'react'

function UserNav() {
  return (
    <div>UserNav</div>
  )
}

export default UserNav
```
