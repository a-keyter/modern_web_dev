# Showing Posts in your feed

In this section, we'll learn to set up a real time listener for new posts on the dashboard.

## Feed component

We can create a feed component which fetches the data from all posts.

We want this to automatically update whenever a new post is added.

Let's start by creating a `Feed.tsx` file in our components.

Use rfce to fill in the initial component outline:

```tsx filename="components/Feed.tsx" copy
import React from 'react'

function Feed() {
  return (
    <div>Feed</div>
  )
}

export default Feed
```

Next, we'll want to set a listener for the data. 

We can use the useCollection hook from Firebase to check for posts in the Database






Initally, we'll just display the posts from the database as JSON.

## Post Component

Next we create a Post Component, which renders the different types of posts.

## Map over all posts

Here, we map over all the posts, using the post component.
