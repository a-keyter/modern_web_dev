# Showing Posts in your feed

In this section, we'll learn to set up a real time listener for new posts on the dashboard.

## Create the Feed component

We can create a feed component which fetches the data from all posts.

We want this to automatically update whenever a new post is added.

Let's start by creating a `Feed.tsx` file in our components.

Use rfce to fill in the initial component outline:

```tsx filename="components/Feed.tsx" copy
import React from 'react'

function Feed() {
  return (
    <div>Feed</div>
  )
}

export default Feed
```

## Listening for updates in the database.

Next, we'll want to set a real time listener for new posts in the feed. 

We can use the useCollection hook from Firebase react-firebase-hooks to check for posts in the Database

Let's start by installing the library from node:

```sh filename="terminal" copy
  npm install react-firebase-hooks
```

Next, we'll want to set the import the useCollection hook from react-firebase-hooks.

* We also need to set the query for our database!


```tsx filename="/components/Feed.tsx" copy
"use client";
import React from "react";

import { db } from "@/firebase";
import { useUser } from "@clerk/nextjs";
import { collection, orderBy, query } from "firebase/firestore";
import { useCollection } from "react-firebase-hooks/firestore";

function Feed() {
  const user = useUser();
  const [docs, loading, error] = useCollection(
    user && query(collection(db, "posts"), orderBy("timestamp", "desc"))
  );
  
  return <div>Feed</div>;
}

export default Feed;
```

### Setting types for a Post object:

Because we're in typescript, we also need to define the types of the object we expect from Firebase:

```tsx filename="/components/Feed.tsx" copy
"use client";
import React from "react";

import { db } from "@/firebase";
import { useUser } from "@clerk/nextjs";
import { collection, orderBy, query } from "firebase/firestore";
import { useCollection } from "react-firebase-hooks/firestore";

export type PostData = {
    content: string;
    postType: string;
    timestamp: Timestamp;
    title: string;
    userId: string;
    imageUrl: string | null;
  };

function Feed() {
  const user = useUser();
  const [docs, loading, error] = useCollection(
    user && query(collection(db, "posts"), orderBy("timestamp", "desc"))
  );
  
  return <div>Feed</div>;
}

export default Feed;
```

We can then map over our posts and add load state handling. 

Initally, we'll just display the posts from the database as JSON.

```tsx filename="/components/Feed.tsx" copy
"use client";
import React from "react";

import { db } from "@/firebase";
import { Timestamp, collection, orderBy, query } from "firebase/firestore";
import { useCollection } from "react-firebase-hooks/firestore";

export type PostData = {
    content: string;
    postType: string;
    timestamp: Timestamp;
    title: string;
    userId: string;
    imageUrl: string | null;
  };
  

function Feed() {
    const [docs, loading, error] = useCollection(
      query(collection(db, "posts"), orderBy("timestamp", "desc"))
    );
  
    if (loading) {
      return <div>Loading...</div>;
    }
  
    if (error) {
      return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
    }
  
    return (
      <div>
        {docs?.docs.map((doc) => {
          const post = doc.data() as PostData;
          return (
            <pre key={doc.id}>
              {JSON.stringify(post, null, 2)}
            </pre>
          );
        })}
      </div>
    );
  }
  
  export default Feed;
```

Finally, we'll import this into our homepage component and remove our ExamplePosts:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" copy
import ExamplePost from "@/components/ExamplePost";
import Feed from "@/components/Feed";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center gap-y-4 p-12 w-full">
      <h1 className="text-6xl font-semibold">Hello World!</h1>
      <p className="text-center text-2xl">This is our first NextJS Project</p>
      <Feed />
    </main>
  );
}
```

Which will give us something like this:

import Image from "next/image";

<br/>

<Image
  src="/forms/first_posts.png"
  alt="Screenshot of page with initial posts loaded."
  width={1000}
  height={1000}
/>


## Creating a Post component:

Now that we've successfully fetched our data from Firestore, we can create a Post component which will render each post type:

Let's create a new component in the components folder called Post.tsx and run rfce to get the initial layout:

```tsx filename="/components/Post.tsx" copy







We also need to map over the data returned from the collection to show our posts.



## Post Component

Next we create a Post Component, which renders the different types of posts.

## Map over all posts

Here, we map over all the posts, using the post component.
