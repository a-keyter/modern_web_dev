# Firebase - One of many Database Providers

The time has come to submit our form to a databse. To do this, we're going to use Firebase.

## Connecting to Firebase

We can connect to Firebase using their SDK, we'll start by creating a firebase project.

Head to the [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and click 'go to console' to get started.

import Image from "next/image";

<br/>

  alt="Screenshot of using vercel sign up page"
  width={1000}
  height={1000}
/>

### Create Your Project

Next, you'll want to click 'add project' to start creating your new firebase instance.

Give your project a name e.g. `nextjs_demo`

<br/>

<Image
  src="/firebase/project_name.png"
  alt="Screenshot of using vercel sign up page"
  width={1000}
  height={1000}
/>


On the next screen, you can turn off Google Analytics (not necessary for our project.)

<br/>

<Image
  src="/firebase/disable_analytics.png"
  alt="Screenshot of using vercel sign up page"
  width={1000}
  height={1000}
/>

Your app will then start to provision. Continue to the next screen when it's done.

### Provision a Firestore

Head over to 'build' on the left hand side of your screen and click Firestore Database.

<br/>

<Image
  src="/firebase/create_firestore.png"
  alt="Screenshot of using vercel sign up page"
  width={1000}
  height={1000}
/>


Then click 'create database'.

<br/>

<Image
  src="/firebase/db_init.png"
  alt="Screenshot of the firestore database page"
  width={1000}
  height={1000}
/>

You can select any region for hosting the data, but it's best to choose one closest to your users.

<br/>

<Image
  src="/firebase/db_name.png"
  alt="Screenshot of the firestore database page"
  width={1000}
  height={1000}
/>

On the next screen, you can set the rules to 'test mode':

<br/>

<Image
  src="/firebase/db_test.png"
  alt="Screenshot of the firestore database page"
  width={1000}
  height={1000}
/>

Your database will now be provisioned, and you can head back to the main page by clicking 'project overview'

### Register your WebApp

Next up, you'll need to register your webapp by clicking the 'web' option.

<Image
  src="/firebase/setup_web.png"
  alt="Screenshot of firebase web provisioning page"
  width={1000}
  height={1000}
/>


You can give your project a new name, and click register:

<br/>

<Image
  src="/firebase/register_app.png"
  alt="Screenshot of using vercel sign up page"
  width={1000}
  height={1000}
/>

Finally, you should be taken to the Firebase SDK page, which will look something like this:

<br/>

<Image
  src="/firebase/fb_sdk.png"
  alt="Screenshot of firebase SDK settings"
  width={1000}
  height={1000}
/>

As per the instructions on this page, you'll want to head back to your project and then run:

```sh copy
npm install firebase
```

Next, you'll want to create a new file at the `package.json` level called: `firebase.ts`

Inside firebase.ts, you'll need to copy the firebase settings:


```ts filename="firebase.ts"
// Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
// TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
// https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries

// Your web app's Firebase configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOURAPIKEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR AUTH DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR DETAILS HERE",
  storageBucket: "YOUR DETAILS HERE",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR DETAILS HERE",
  appId: "YOUR DETAILS HERE",
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
```

Now, we're going to use a number of different firebase sdks, so you'll need to ammend your file as follows:


```ts filename="firebase.ts" {1,2, 3,}copy
// Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need
import { getApp, getApps, initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";
import { getStorage } from "firebase/storage";

// Your web app's Firebase configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOURAPIKEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR AUTH DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR DETAILS HERE",
  storageBucket: "YOUR DETAILS HERE",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR DETAILS HERE",
  appId: "YOUR DETAILS HERE",
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = getApps().length ? getApp() : initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

// Set Database Reference
const db = getFirestore(app);

// Set File Store Reference
const storage = getStorage(app);

// Export Database Ref and Storage Object Ref
export { db, storage };
```

## Processing Form Data

Now that we've set up our connection to firebase, we can prepare to submit our form data.

In your `lib` folder, create a new folder called `actions`

Inside your `actions` folder, create a file called submitPost.ts

We'll define a function called submitPost here, which handles post submission:

```ts filename="@/lib/actions/submitPost.ts" copy
import { db } from "@/firebase";
import { addDoc, collection, serverTimestamp } from "firebase/firestore";

// Note that you have to define the types of the args we pass to the function.
export default async function submitPost(postType: string, title: string, content: string, userId: string) {
    try {
        const docRef = await addDoc(collection(db, "users", userId, "posts"), {
            postType,
            title,
            content,
            timestamp: serverTimestamp(),
        });
        console.log("Document written with ID: ", docRef.id);
    } catch (e) {
        console.error("Error adding document: ", e);
    }
}
```

## Send Form to Firebase onSubmit

Now that we've set up our database and our submission action, we can redefine our onSubmit function for our form:

```tsx filename="components/HumanTextForm.tsx" copy
export default function HumanTextForm() {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const { isLoaded, isSignedIn, user } = useUser();

  const form = useForm({
    resolver: zodResolver(formSchema),
    defaultValues: {
      post_title: "",
      post_content: "",
    },
  });

  const onSubmit = async (values) => {
    if (!isSignedIn || !user) {
      console.error("User is not signed in");
      return;
    }

    setLoading(true);

    try {
      await submitPost("postType", values.post_title, values.post_content, user.id);
      console.log("Post submitted successfully");
      form.reset(); // Clear the form fields
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error submitting post:", error);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };

  return(
    // Rest of the Return Function as before
  )};

  ```

## Test it out

You can now fill in your form and see if it works.

<br/>

<Image
  src="/firebase/first_post.png"
  alt="Screenshot of firebase SDK settings"
  width={1000}
  height={1000}
/>


If it doesn't work, check your console to see if there are any errors.


### Fill your database with dummy data.

I recommend you make several posts which you will be able to fetch from the database in the next step.
