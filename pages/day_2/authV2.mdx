# Authentication with Clerk

Okay... No luck with Supabase Auth.

Luckily, we can just use a cloud provider Clerk.

Head [here](https://clerk.com/) and sign up via GitHub

## Delete Supabase things...

If you followed the original tutorial for auth with Supabase, I'm sorry.

Please delete the `utils/supabase` folder, the `login` folder and `the auth/route`

## Working with Clerk.

Once you've deleted the Supbase rubbish, you can proceed with Clerk as per their onboarding guide:

Install Clerk:

```sh filename="terminal" copy
npm install @clerk/nextjs
```

Then follow the docs to 

* Set up your .env.local variables

and

* Set up your middleware

Next, you can update you main layout.tsx file

```tsx filename="layout.tsx" copy
import type { Metadata } from "next";
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";
import "./globals.css";
import NavBar from "@/components/NavBar";

import {
  ClerkProvider,
} from '@clerk/nextjs'

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] });

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "NextJS, Clerk, GenAI",
  description: "Alex's First AI Course for LCR Developers",
};

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider>
    <html lang="en" className="h-screen">
      <body className={inter.className + " h-full"}>
        <NavBar/>
        {children}
        </body>
    </html>
    </ClerkProvider>

  );
}
```

Also update your NavBar component:

```tsx filename="NavBar.tsx" copy
import Link from "next/link";
import React from "react";
import { Button } from "./ui/button";
import SignOut from "./SignOut";
import { SignInButton, SignedIn, SignedOut, UserButton } from "@clerk/nextjs";


export default function NavBar() {
  const NavLinks = [
    {
      name: "Home",
      href: "/",
    },
    {
      name: "Contact",
      href: "/contact",
    },
  ];

  return (
    <div className="w-full flex flex-1 justify-end gap-x-4 py-2 pr-4">
      {NavLinks.map((link) => (
        <Link
          key={link.name}
          href={link.href}
          style={{ textDecoration: "none" }}
        >
          <Button>{link.name}</Button>
        </Link>
      ))}
      <SignedOut>
          <SignInButton mode="modal" forceRedirectUrl={"/dashboard"}/>
        </SignedOut>
        <SignedIn>
          <UserButton afterSignOutUrl="/" />
        </SignedIn>
     </div>
  );
}
```

Now try it out. This was way easier. Sorry for being confusing.

## Moving Forward

As a programmer, it's important to accept that you're going to mess things up sometimes.

That's okay - let's focus on the cool things we can build.
