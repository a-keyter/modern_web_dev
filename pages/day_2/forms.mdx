# Forms with ShadCN & ZOD

For this initial demo project, we're going to create a simple dashboard where users can create posts to a shared feed.

We'll set three different types of post, one for Human Text, one for AI Text, and one for AI Images.

We'll also set up row level security, such that the user who created a post is able to delete their own post.

## Data Schema

Before we get started collecting data from our user, we need to define our database Schema.

In this case we'll have the following data to work with:

post_type: string [human_text, genai_text, genai_image]
title: string
content: string
created_by: uuid, references user.uuid
created_at: Date

**In today's session, we're only going to focus on human_text posts.**
