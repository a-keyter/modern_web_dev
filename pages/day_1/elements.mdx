# Making Pages in NextJS

If you've made it this far, well done! Setting up a development environment is slow and painful for the first time.

Now that we've got a live development server, let's learn how to put content on our pages.

## Clearing out the default content.

We'll start by removing all of the content from the page.tsx file, leaving only the main tag and a h1 header.

```ts filename="page.tsx" {4} copy
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```

For those familiar with HTML, you'll notice that we essentially have a Javascript function which returns some HTML.

This essentially means we have access to the functionality of both languages within the same file.

The code snippet above, will give us the following page:

<br/>

import Image from 'next/image'
 
<Image src="/hello_world.png" alt="Screenshot of using Create Next App" width={1000} height={1000} />

## Styling with Tailwind CSS.

If you're anything like me, you probably don't enjoy writing CSS in a separate file to the place that you declare an element.

Luckily, in NextJS, we can just declare styles on the fly with Tailwind CSS. 

You can declare styles by:

1. Adding a className tag to the element you want to style.

2. Use the tailwind shorthand class for the properties you wish to set.

Here are some of the most common tailwind classes that I use:

* flex / flex-col / flex-row - Sets flex properties on the element.
* justify-center / justify-between - Spaces elements along flex direction.
* items-center - Aligns items at 90degrees to their flex direction.
* text-xl / font-semibold - Set the text-size and font.
* bg-purple-400 - Sets the background color of an element.


```ts filename="page.tsx" {3, 4, 5} copy
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center gap-y-4 p-24">
      <h1 className="text-6xl font-semibold">Hello World!</h1>
      <p className="text-center text-2xl">This is our first NextJS Project</p>
    </main>
  );
}
```

If we save our file and check our development server, we should see something like this:

<br/>

<Image src="/hello_world_styled.png" alt="Screenshot of using Create Next App" width={1000} height={1000} />

## Don't struggle on your own.

Setting the styling for all of your components can take a long while, and not everyone has the time.

In the next section, we'll look at a UI library which comes with pre-styled component for your application.

### Bonus - Pre Made Tailwind CSS styles

The Tailwind CSS Library has lots of awesome functionality and, as with most things in software, the best way to learn about what you can do with tailwind is to [check the docs](https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs). 

However, you can also learn a lot about Tailwind by just seeing other peoples components.

Fortunately, the UI library we're about to see has us covered!
