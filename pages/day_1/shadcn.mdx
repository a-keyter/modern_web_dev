# ShadCN - An Awesome UI Library

Fortunately for developers who don't have the time or experience to design the components they will use in their apps, there are a number of UI libraries available.

One of the most popular UI libraries for this is [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

Shadcn gives us a number of 'Components' that we can incorporate into our apps, ranging from inputs, buttons and forms all the way through to to tables and drop down menus.

## Installing ShadCN in a NextJS App

As per the documentation, we can install the library from the terminal within our project:

```sh copy
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

You'll then be asked a number of questions, you can acccept the default for each:

```
Which style would you like to use? › Default
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Slate
Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? › no / yes
```

Now, you'll be able to add UI components to your project from shadcn.

```sh copy
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button input
```

## Using ShadCN Components

Now that you've installed the UI components, you can incorporate them into your page:

```ts filename="page.tsx" {3} copy
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center gap-y-8 p-24 w-full">
      <h1 className="text-6xl font-semibold">Hello World!</h1>
      <p className="text-center text-2xl">This is our first NextJS Project</p>
      <div className="flex w-full max-w-xl gap-x-4">
        <Input placeholder="Enter your email address" className="w-full"></Input>
        <Button>Sign Up!</Button>
      </div>
    </main>
  );
}
```

This gives us a page that looks like this:
