# Building with Components

In the last section, we added some UI elements from the ShadCN library to make a newsletter signup form.

But what if we want to use this signup form elsewhere in our app?

This is where React comes in, with an idea called Components.

## What is a Component?

A Component is an independent part of an application which can be reused accross multiple screens.

Rather than writing the same code multiple times, we can define a component once, and use it on multiple pages.

For example:

* Navigation Bar
* Posts in a feed
* Tables to show data
* Newsletter signup form

## Let's make our first component together.

We'll start by creating a new file `Email_Signup.tsx` in our 'components' folder.

Then we can use the `rfce` code snippet to create a react component.

NB. COMPONENTS MUST ALWAYS START WITH A CAPITAL LETTER.

```ts filename="/app/components/Email_Signup.tsx"
rfce
```

Which will give us:

```ts filename="/app/components/Email_Signup.tsx"
import React from 'react'

function Email_Signup() {
  return (
    <div>Email</div>
  )
}

export default Email_Signup
```

We can now go back to our main page.tsx file and copy the content from our component:


```tsx filename="/app/components/Email_Signup.tsx" copy
import React from "react";

import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";

function Email_Signup() {
  return (
    <Card className="flex flex-col gap-y-4 p-4">
      <h2 className="text-center">Stay in the know!</h2>
      <div className="flex w-full max-w-xl gap-x-4">
        <Input placeholder="Enter your email address" className="w-full" />
        <Button>Sign Up!</Button>
      </div>
    </Card>
  );
}

export default Email_Signup;

```

Finally, we can import the component into our main page:

```tsx filename="@/page.tsx" {1, 8} copy
import Email_Signup from "@/components/Email_Signup";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center gap-y-8 p-24 w-full">
      <h1 className="text-6xl font-semibold">Hello World!</h1>
      <p className="text-center text-2xl">This is our first NextJS Project</p>
      <Email_Signup />
    </main>
  );
}
```

And there you have it, you've made your first React Component.

In the next section, we'll look at making multi-page apps which reuse this component.
