# Dream, Build, Ship

If you've made it this far, congratulations! **You're now ready to ship your first ever project!**

By 'ship' I mean delivering the software you've created to the web so that other people can try it.

`Shipping software is one of the most important parts of being a developer.`

And luckily, it's free and relatively easy to do it, thanks to Vercel

## Using Vercel to Deploy your Work

There comes a time for every NextJS project to go live, now is the time for our project.

Head over to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home) and Sign Up using your GitHub account.

<br/>

import Image from 'next/image'
 
<Image src="/vercel_home.png" alt="Screenshot of using vercel sign up page" width={1000} height={1000} />

Once you've logged in, head to `Add New` and then `project`

Then you'll need to import your project from your github repo. Allow Vercel access to view your repositories.

You can add your project repo, then set the name of your project.

When you're ready, click `Deploy` and Vercel will start to build your project.

Build time typically takes about a minute and a half.
