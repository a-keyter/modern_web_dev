# Let's create our first NextJS App

## Create a Directory for your NextJS Projects

To start off, I recommend creating an easy to find Directory where you can store this (and future projects)

Go to your Desktop and right click to create a new folder, which you can call 'NextJS_Projects'

Then right-click on the folder, and click run in terminal.

## Create our first NextJS App.

To create our first NextJS App, we use the command:

```sh filename="terminal" {3} copy
npx create-next-app@latest 
```

We'll call our first project: `day_1_example`

We'll then have a number of options, we can select the default options for all:

<br/>

import Image from 'next/image'
 
<Image src="/create_app.png" alt="Screenshot of using Create Next App" width={1000} height={1000} />


When this is complete, we'll change into the directory we've just created:

```sh filename="terminal" {3} copy
cd day_1_example
```

Then we can open our new project in VS Code using the following command:

```sh filename="terminal" {3} copy
code .
```

Now, if you open the app folder and click page, you should see the following:

<br/>

<Image src="/default_app.png" alt="Screenshot of the initial Next App" width={1000} height={1000} />

We can deploy our site by opening our terminal ( ctrl + shift + ' ) in vs code and running the following command:

```sh filename="terminal" {3} copy
npm run dev
```

This will initialise the development server, and your app should go live to http://localhost:3000/

<Image src="/next_landing.png" alt="Screenshot of the Default Next App" width={1000} height={1000} />

In the next section, we'll remove the default page elements and explore how we can create our own pages.
