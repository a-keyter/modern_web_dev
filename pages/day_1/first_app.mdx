# Let's create our first NextJS App

## Create a Directory for your NextJS Projects

To start off, I recommend creating an easy to find Directory where you can store this (and future projects)

Go to your Desktop and right click to create a new folder, which you can call 'NextJS_Projects'

Then right-click on the folder, and click run in terminal.

## Create our first NextJS App.

To create our first NextJS App, we use the command:

```sh filename="terminal" {3} copy
npx create-next-app@latest 
```

This will give us a number of options, we can select the default for all.

import Image from 'next/image'
 
<Image src="/create_app.png" alt="Screenshot of using Create Next App" width={1000} height={1000} />
