# NodeJS & NPM

Great, now that we've got all of our dependencies installed, we can finally get Node JS and Node Package Manager.

Node JS can be installed from their website [here](https://nodejs.org/en).

Simply download the installer and follow the installation instructions. You do not need chocolatey as we have installed Python and VS Build Tools separately.
