# git - Version control

You also need to install `git` a version control system that enables you to track changes across your project.

You can download it [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Setting your git config

Once you've downloaded and installed git, you'll need to add config for your GitHub account.

You can do this by opening your terminal and setting your username:

```sh filename="terminal" copy
git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"
```

and your user email:
```sh filename="terminal" copy
git config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"
```
