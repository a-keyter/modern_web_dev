# Visual Studio Build Tools

To run Node, we'll also want to install Visual Studio Build Tools,

We can do this by visiting the [Visual Studio - Downloads Page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

Then Scroll to the Tools for Visual Studio and select Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022

In the installer, you'll select the C++ and the NodeJS packages.
